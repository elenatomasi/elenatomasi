Teaching
======
I recently organized and participated in the [Artificial Intelligence for Weather and Climate Autumn School 2024](https://dsip.fbk.eu/aiwcas2024/), hosted by FBK with financial support form [ICSC, the National Centre for HPC, Big Data and Quantum Computing](https://www.supercomputing-icsc.it/en/icsc-home/). I tutored and mentored students in developing AI solutions for earth sciences, giving lectures, handling hands-on projects, and fostering interdisciplinary problem-solving. Back in the day, from 2015 to 2017, I served as a teaching assistant for the Fluid Mechanics course for Civil and Environmental engineering students at [DICAM](https://www.dicam.unitn.it/en) - University of Trento. In 2017 I was awarded the NSF-NCAR Research Applications Laboratory - RAL’s [Warner Internship for Scientific Enrichment
(WISE) Fellowship](https://ral.ucar.edu/opportunity/warner-internship-for-scientific-enrichment-wise) to mentor and inspire girls in STEMs through hands-on atmospheric science workshops and research-driven activities.

Divulgation
======
Fondazione Bruno Kessler recently appointed me as an [FBK Science Ambassador](https://magazine.fbk.eu/en/news/introducing-fbks-25-future-science-ambassadors/). In this role, I aim to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and the wider community. My role involves sharing scientific advancements in artificial intelligence, meteorology, and climate modeling with diverse audiences, from policymakers and industry leaders to students and the general public. Through outreach, collaboration, and communication, I help translate complex research into meaningful insights, fostering awareness and engagement in the intersection of technology, earth system science, and innovation.
